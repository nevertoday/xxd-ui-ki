# XXD UI Kit

[中文](README.md) · **English**

A quiet, restrained set of UI components: square corners, black, white and gray, hairlines, system fonts.

- Plain web pages: one CSS file and one JS file. No React needed.
- Chrome extensions: one command sets up a side panel and a settings page, in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English.
- React projects: a matching set of components.

**See every component: <https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/en/>**

![The same extension side panel four ways: light and dark, square and rounded](docs/assets/overview.png)

> Early days (0.x). Not on npm yet, and versions may break things (see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.en.md)).

## Is it for you?

Yes if you build Chrome extensions, small sites or tool pages, and like the look in the screenshot above.

Not if you need:

- Big admin apps, complex forms and data tables: use [Ant Design](https://ant.design).
- Component source copied into your project to edit freely: use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).
- A completely different style: you can change the accent color, corners and density, but not the style itself.

## Try it (nothing to install)

Paste this into a new HTML file and open it in a browser:

```html
<script src="https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/v/0.1.0/boot.js" data-key="my-site-ui"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/v/0.1.0/xxd.css" />
<script src="https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/v/0.1.0/icons.js"></script>
<script src="https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/v/0.1.0/xxd.js"></script>

<body class="xxd-page">
  <button class="xxd-btn" data-variant="primary">Save</button>
</body>
```

Every component on the showcase has markup you can copy.

## Using it for real: install once

You need Node 24.12+ and pnpm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-ui-kit.git
cd xxd-ui-kit
pnpm install
pnpm xxd:build   # takes a few minutes the first time
pnpm xxd link    # installs the xxd-ui command so it works from any folder
```

Then pick what you're doing:

### Make a Chrome extension

```bash
xxd-ui new ./today --name 今日待办 --name-en Today --slug today
```

Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, click "Load unpacked" and pick the `today` folder. It works right away.

Add more with flags: `--popup` for the small window behind the toolbar icon, `--content "https://example.com/*"` to put UI on web pages, `--account` for sign-in and membership pages.
More in the [extension kit](docs/en/EXTENSION-KIT.md).

### Add it to an existing page or extension

```bash
xxd-ui init ./my-site
```

It copies the component files into `my-site` and tells you which lines to add to `<head>`.

Your site already has its own color variables and shouldn't change: see [existing sites](docs/en/existing-site.md).
Using a bundler like Vite: see [Get started](https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/en/start) on the showcase.

### Use it in React

```bash
xxd-ui pack ./packs          # in xxd-ui-kit: build the packages
npm install ./packs/*.tgz    # in your project
```

```tsx
import { Button } from "@xxd/react";
import "@xxd/react/standalone.css";
```

Tailwind, appearance and language settings: see [Get started](https://ui.xiaoxiaodong.ai/en/start).

## When components get updated

```bash
xxd-ui status          # which projects are on an old version
xxd-ui sync --all      # update them all
xxd-ui doctor ./today  # check for typos, hard-coded colors and extension config problems
```

## Finding components and icons

```bash
xxd-ui doc dialog   # how to write one component (English or Chinese name)
xxd-ui icon delete  # find an icon among 500+
xxd-ui help         # every command
```
